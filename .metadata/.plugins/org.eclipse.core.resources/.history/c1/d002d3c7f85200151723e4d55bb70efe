/**
 * A TokenIdConverter convert the tokens in a single file or the files in a
 * directory to their ids which are separated by a delimiter "|" which stand for
 * the separators in the original text, e.g. commas, newline characters etc., to
 * identify segments in the resulted id sequence; the id of a token is the line
 * number whose line begins with the token in the token list file, with the line
 * number counted from zero.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Because some words in the files can be missing from the token list,
 * extracting all separators in a file may result in some empty segments. This
 * situation is considered and is handled by automatically removing these empty
 * segments.
 * <p>
 * 
 * When the input is a single text file, the output will also be a text file. If
 * the specified output is an existing directory, then an error will occur;
 * however, when the input is a directory consisting of multiple text files, the
 * specified output stands for a directory to take in the resulted files. For
 * each token file in the input directory, a file with the same filename will be
 * created in the output directory to represent the resulted id sequence by
 * processing the token file.
